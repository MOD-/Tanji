This project has been abandoned, sorry.

I'm stopping development on this project, but I'm not taking down the repository(unlike last time). I've been feeling 'restricted' to only work on this project because there are many that expect updates/features/fixes, but this is my fault since I'm always saying "I will fix it" so I only tend to work on this instead of other stuff that I actually want to work on.

Maintaining this project has also become very tideous/boring for me, I just don't see the fun in it that I used to before. I really enjoyed playing around with the NovoFatum plugin API back in the days, but I can't anymore because 'I need to fix that one thing in Tanji'. Well I can, but I wouldn't good with myself knowing there are issues that need to be fixed but don't want to because 'I'm playing around'.

I want to do other stuff with what I've learnt over these past 2-3 years, but like I've said before:
"I don't feel at ease working on another project while I know this (high demanding)project has several issues that need to be fixed."

TL;DR: I'm bored of it, want to do other stuff(Probably still habbo related, since I've still yet to try some 'stuff'.)
